What is the program?
It is tic tac toe. It is a game played between two clients (player one and player two). It is a game that is played using the best out of n games framework. The number of games played is kept track and the record is also kept track and printed at the end. The first player chooses the number of games played n. The second player always gets the first move in each game.
How to run the program?
Use the “Makefile” provided and run the program using “make” in the terminal. Run the program using one server and two clients. Run the server using the command “./server 3240” and connect the clients using “./client localhost 3240”. The next steps are just to follow the game instructions and the input directions to proceed. You will be able to play tic tac toe with two clients and a server model.
